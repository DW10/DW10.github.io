I work clinically as a Doctor (Junior Clinical Fellow) in the UCLH Department of Critical Care and a PhD Student within the [tech4health](https://www.tech4health.co.uk/cdt-researchers-cohort2/dylan-whitaker) CDT at UCL. Clinically my intrests in acute care and anaesthtics with plans to persue a training number in anaesthetics. 

Academically, I work within the [UCL Health Algorithm Laboratory](https://uclhal.org) supervised by [Steve Harris](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4982-1374) and [Matthew Wilson](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5001-0253). My research interests revolve around how we can better understand and leverage the vast amount of health data produced daily into actionable evidence to help deliver better and safer care for patients. 

Opioids represent a key pillar of pain treatment but carry significant risks. I hope to better understand how we treat pain from surgery, uncover opportunities, and design the strategies that will reduce the risks for the millions of patients undergoing surgery each year.

I hope to employ a range of analytical techniques, including retrospective causal inference, predictive ML, and interventional science, to ensure success in bringing change to the patient’s bedside. 

 Outside of work, I spent much of my time coxing for Cambridge University Boat Club and racing a [Boat Race](https://row-360.com/the-gemini-boat-race-2021/) or two whilst trying to [keep up my studies](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/cambridge-university-hospital-cambridge-cambridgeshire-ely-b926169.html). Having hung up my coxbox and am now using my trainers for more than sitting down in the 9th seat and can be found pounding the pavements around Westminster and Hyde Park.
